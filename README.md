# Lacus
--So Hey there, Uh. To this off. Welcome to Kiwi!
Lacus is a Coding language built for roblox luau.
The reason i build this to mostly fix some issues i've had that i really never wanted to have to re-code over and over manually.
even copy and pasting gets hard when its like 20 scripts.
So im building this.
